## Learning Goals

As this application was built during Phase 1 of the Flatiron School's Software Engineering program, our primary goal was to continue learning. Focus of this project was to develop JavaScript fundamentals and utilize an API. In addition to JavaScript, I also utilized SCSS to compile the CSS for the site.
